The code you will find here is for an Arduino Weather Station. The weather station connects to Wifi and sends data to a database. It is later displayed in a nice format. In other words:

ESP8266 -> PHP Page -> MySQL DB -> PHP -> Nice HTML Graphs.

You will find the code for all of these, with some comments, here.
